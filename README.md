# Text-to-Image Generation Using Stable Diffusion

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **Stable Diffusion**, a state-of-the-art AI model, to generate high-quality images from textual descriptions. By leveraging **Hugging Face**, **PyTorch** and **Diffusers**, we transform human-written text into images, showcasing the potential of generative AI. 

The core idea behind this project is to bridge the gap between **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Computer Vision (CV)** by generating realistic images based on detailed descriptions. The model uses a text prompt as input and produces a corresponding image, making it a powerful tool for content creation, storytelling, and more.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to explore how AI-based generative models, specifically **Stable Diffusion**, can convert natural language descriptions into images. By utilizing pre-trained models from platforms like **Hugging Face**, this project demonstrates how modern AI technologies are capable of generating creative content from text prompts, which have applications across various fields including art, advertising, and design.

## Features

- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Translates detailed text descriptions into realistic images.
- **Hugging Face Integration**: Utilizes models from Hugging Face for ease of use and access to cutting-edge AI tools.
- **Customization**: The project allows for custom prompts to generate various types of images based on user input.

## Requirements

Before running the code, you need to set up your environment with the following Python libraries:

- `torch` (PyTorch)
- `diffusers`
- `transformers`
- `accelerate`
- `matplotlib`
- `huggingface_hub`
